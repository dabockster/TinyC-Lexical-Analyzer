TinyC-Lexical-Analyzer
======================

This program is an attempt at writing a lexical analyzer for a hypothetical programming language called TinyC.

The main purpose of this program was to teach me how compilers interpret lexems when compiling source code.

At first, I began by reading the file line by line (referenced in main_old.cpp). However, I kept getting a bug via one of the methods requiring a weird data type inheritance (a classic C++ problem, in my opinion).
